<p class="dropCap">I have a problem. Whenever I start a project or whenever I am informed of one that people wish to bring me on board with, my addiction kicks in. Sometimes my addiction slows me down, but most of the time it helps me finish a project better than it was originally expected. I am addicted to practical and applicable knowledge.</p>

<p>Do you ever sit down to work on a project and find yourself moving slowly in the beginning because there is something you don’t know completely? Yea, that’s me. I have started web projects and found myself taking breaks to absorb information on something that I didn’t know well enough to be able to accomplish on my own. In the very beginning, it was very aggravating to me because things I didn’t know very well were things like HTML, CSS, Sass, and Jade. It annoyed me because they were such big items I had to learn. That addiction, however, forced me to learn these things and learn them well.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cmhumphries.com/blog/3-signs-youre-addicted-to-learning" target="_blank">C.M. Humphries has an intriguing post called “3 Signs You’re Addicted to Learning”.</a> Now, I agree with some of the points made in this post, but it does not quite depict my addiction or the reason behind it. I do not become bored of the things that I learn, nor do I find them to become lame. I still love it, I just love learning more. I do not see anything wrong with this because it will always benefit me. I find it very helpful to me all of the time. Now if you’d excuse me, I have to go learn to write better. ;)</p>
